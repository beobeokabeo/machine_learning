I would now like to turn the call over to your host  Ms  Karen Hoguet  Please go ahead  maam 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Great  thank you  Good morning and welcome to the Macys  Inc  conference call scheduled to discuss our third quarter earnings  I am Karen Hoguet  CFO of the company 
Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited  A replay of the call will be available on our website  www MacysInc com  beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes  Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non GAAP financial measures discussed this morning 
Keep in mind that all forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the companys actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company  including the risks specified in the companys most recently filed Form K and other SEC filings 
We are pleased with our third quarter performance  which was consistent with our expectations  As we have said all year  we are in the process of setting ourselves up for a comeback  and we remain on that path  We are on track to deliver our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance of to  And we are increasing our sales guidance to an annual decline ofto on an owned plus licensed basis versus our prior guidance of minus to minus  And in addition to feeling good about our operating performance  were also pleased by the progress weve made on the real estate front  Well talk more about this later 
So lets start with some commentary on the third quarter  Ill then update you on our progress with our real estate strategy  talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter  and then end by taking your questions 
Sales in the third quarter were  billion  downfrom last year and downon a comp owned plus licensed basis  Our growth strategies are beginning to gain traction in our top doors and in key areas such as fine jewelry  shoes and home  Plus  we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our apparel businesses; mens  womens and kids  We were pleased that the performance improved for many of our major apparel brands during the quarter  including our exclusive brands such as INC and Tommy Hilfiger 
We also saw strength in shoes  fragrances and soft home  which includes textiles  tabletop and housewares  These trends are offsetting some of the weakness in handbags  cosmetics and fashion watches 
Its actually was encouraging that our fashion watch trend did improve  as our expanded tech watch assortment hit our stores and websites late in the quarter  including products from brands like Apple and Michael Kors  The category trends were generally similar at both Macys and Bloomingdales 
Our digital business had another strong quarter  with double digit gains at both Macys com and Bloomingdales com 
Geographically  our business was strongest throughout the West  International tourist sales stabilized during the quarter and were down in line with the rest of our sales  As a result  the international tourist business did not have a meaningful impact on our sales in total  although it still represented a headwind for our major international tourist stores for both Bloomingdales and Macys 
Average unit retail increasedin the third quarter  which is great news  This compares to aincrease in the first half of the year  This helped offset the impact of fewer transactions in the third quarter  This was the same reduction in transactions as we saw in the first half of the year 
As we discussed after the second quarter  we continue to be optimistic about Bluemercury as well as our Backstage shops within our Macys stores  In the fourth quarter  we are testing putting Backstage pop up apparel shops in approximately Macys doors  with merchandise being procured by our Backstage team  This merchandise will be put adjacent to our Last Act clearance areas and  like Last Act  will be coupon free 
In addition  in of these stores  were also adding some new categories of merchandise being procured by the Backstage team  including toys  home decor and queue products  Those are the items you often see as youre waiting to check out at various retailers  Weve put this queue product adjacent to the highest traffic POS locations in these stores  We think these could end up being additive to many of our Macys locations 
We also remain encouraged by the learnings and progress being made in China  Not only are we developing a potentially large high growth business  but  as importantly  we are learning about ways we could improve our digital business in the United States as well as how we could assort our stores and websites to better serve the Chinese consumer  whether living in the U S  or traveling here 
Gross margin rate in the third quarter was  equal to a year ago  We are very pleased with this performance  It reflects the benefit of lower inventory levels and the impact of our Last Act clearance strategy  At the end of the quarter  comparable inventory was down approximately  This gives us great liquidity  providing us the flexibility to react to trends during the fourth quarter 
SG AndA in the quarter was  billion  upversus last year  Much of this increase is related to lower asset sale gains this year  We recognized  million of these gains in the third quarter this year  which compares to  million last year 
As you know  asset sales will be lumpy by quarter and are hard to forecast  Most of the gains in the quarter this year relate to the transaction announced last week with General Growth Properties as well as the million booked relating to the Brooklyn transaction in the quarter  If you exclude these gains in both years  SG AndA dollars were up This is consistent with what we expected  but I suspect it may seem high to you  given our performance earlier in the year 
We continue to benefit from both the restructuring that we completed at year end and also the store closures  but these benefits are being more than offset by other increases including selling  where we are investing in our key locations as well as in the strategic families of business I mentioned earlier  This staffing is supporting our growth strategies and incorporates the omni channel activities that we now ask our store associates to perform  This investment is resulting in improved customer service scores  and we expect higher sales  albeit on a lag basis 
Were also continuing to invest in digital growth as well as in our Bluemercury  China and Backstage initiatives  And our earnings from credit weremillion in the third quarter  which is  million lower than a year ago  Our overall sales reduction hurts our credit income and this was magnified by a reduction in the usage of our proprietary card 
Proprietary card penetration was still very high in the third quarter  at  but it was basis points lower than a year ago  The lower credit sales  combined with slightly lower portfolio yields  continue to negatively impact the income produced relative to a year ago  Having said that  our credit portfolio continues to be very strong in terms of its return on assets 
Operating income in the quarter  excluding settlement charge related to our retirement plans  wasmillion  The non cash settlement charges in the quarter were  million on a pre tax basis  or per share after tax 
Interest expense was  million; tax expensemillion  So net income attributable to Macys shareholders was  million  Excluding settlement charges and impairments from both years  net profit was  million this year  down from last yearsmillion  Average diluted share count in the quarter was million shares 
Earnings per share were this quarter as compared to last year  Excluding settlement and impairment charges  earnings were per share in the quarter this year  down from per share last year  And while well below a year ago  this performance is consistent with our expectations and the annual guidance which we had provided 
For the nine months of this year  cash provided by operating activities wasmillion  which is  million higher than a year ago  This is primarily due to the reduction in inventory net of payables  which resulted from our store closings and our efforts to improve inventory turnover  And  as you heard earlier  this reduction in inventory is helping not only our cash  but also our gross margin rate and potentially our sales as well 
Cash used by investing activities wasmillion this year million lower than last year  This is due tomillion lower capital spending  higher proceeds from our asset sales and last years acquisition of Bluemercury  Therefore  our cash flow before financing activities ismillion above last year  We did resume our stock buyback in the quarter  buying backmillion shares  utilizingmillion of cash  And year to date  we have bought backmillion shares formillion 
At the end of the quarter  we had accessed the commercial paper market for  million  which was a lower amount than we had anticipated  And we expect to be out of the short term debt market by early December  following amillion debt maturity payment on December
With the strong cash flow and the proceeds from asset sales expected in the coming months  many of you are asking about how we plan to utilize this cash  As you know  we always start with funding our business needs  We then look to utilize excess cash for returns to our shareholders through our dividend and through repurchasing stock  We may also repurchase debt at some point  to help make sure that our credit ratios get back to within our targeted range in a reasonable amount of time  We are currently above our targeted debt to EBITDA ratio of  to  
This ratio was  at the end of the third quarter on a rolling four quarter basis  Remember that that does include the weak fourth quarter last year  But we will look at the balance sheet and the ratios at year end  in conjunction with our plan for the next few years  before we make any decisions on our future utilization of excess cash 
In addition to our as expected operating results in the quarter  we made a great deal of progress on real estate  Our real estate strategy can be divided into three parts  The first is our flagship assets which  as you know  we have defined as Herald Square in New York  Union Square in San Francisco  State Street in Chicago and our downtown Minneapolis store  We have signed a contract to sell our Union Square mens building  This separate building is approximatelysquare feet  and we are selling it for approximatelymillion  We expect this transaction to close in January 
We will utilize a part of the proceeds to consolidate our mens merchandise back into the main Union Square store and to make it an even more exciting shopping experience  We will be leasing the mens building back for two to three years as we complete this construction  We will receive the cash for this transaction in January when it closes  but under GAAP  we will be not be booking the approximatelymillion gain until January of
We also are continuing to explore options for downtown Minneapolis  Chicago and Herald Square  Of the three  we expect Herald Square will take the longest to determine the best approach for potentially creating value  given its size and complexity 
The second component of our real estate strategy relates to the approximately  stores we intend to close  As we discussed last quarter  most of these are under performing stores and are less critical to our footprint  but a few represent opportunities where we believe the real estate value exceeds the value as a retail entity  We announced today that we have a signed contract to sell our downtown Portland store  This transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter  with proceeds of approximately  million and a book gain of approximately  million  This store will be closed in early
Additionally  as you saw last week  we sold five locations to GGP for a total of  million  One of these stores is already closed  Three will close in early and we will continue to lease back and operate Tysons Galleria while GGP determines the best use for this property  There are also two other stores that we will be closing Douglaston in New York; and Lancaster Mall in Salem  Oregon  These are being closed based on the timing of lease terminations and expirations 
So  in total  as of today  we have closed or announced plans to close eight stores as part of the  stores discussed last quarter  with Tysons Galleria being sold in leaseback  We are working on many other transactions like these for the locations that we believe we should close 
While Eastdil Secured continues to advise us on the flagship properties and other significant assets  we have also now engaged CBRE to help facilitate the disposition of the majority of our closed or to be closed locations 
That brings us to the third component of our real estate strategy  which is to create value from our remaining real estate portfolio  Macys has real estate assets with significant value creation opportunities  but we recognize that realizing these opportunities will often require alternative uses for the property and some amount of related development  We sought out a world class partner with both capital and strong platform capabilities to help us with this component of our strategy  and we found this in Brookfield Asset Management  Brookfield is one of the leading global investors in real estate  spanning all major sectors; office  multi family  hospitality and retail  particularly regional malls 
As you can imagine  there was tremendous interest among real estate investors to partner with Macys  We are very excited about the potential of this alliance  We believe that the potential risk adjusted value from pursuing this path on these assets could be significantly higher than the outright sales today 
We have kept this alliance as simple as we could  In short  we are giving Brookfield an exclusive right for up to months to create a pre development plan on each of approximately assets that are initially included in this agreement  We have the option to add additional assets to this alliance in the future 
These to be redeveloped assets are a combination of stores; portions of stores; and outparcels  both adjacent to our stores and  in some cases  in our parking fields  While we might close stores in some of these locations  it is more likely that we will create value with surplus land or through improvements alongside an existing store 
The locations initially chosen are varied in their quality  These are just not all our A mall locations  This should give us insight into the potential of our total portfolio  And  in most cases  the assets that we initially have selected are not in malls with the major mall owners 
Potential redevelopments in this strategic alliance can range to what we would call modest to more substantial opportunities  and will factor in feasibility as well as impact on store operations 
On the modest side  Macys has successfully done this ourselves  for example adding restaurants within the Bloomingdales in South Coast Plaza in Southern California; or putting in a Louis Vuitton shop outside our flagship store in Union Square in San Francisco  The great thing  though  about this alliance is it allows us to keep our focus as a top retailer while optimizing our real estate  doing it in scale and potentially thinking much bigger 
And a hypothetical example of a more substantial redevelopment opportunity could be the following  Take an eight acre standalonesquare foot furniture store  One idea might be to move the furniture operations back into a nearby Macys mall location  demolish the furniture store  and then densify the site with a newly built  for example square foot of retail  a new parking garage and a mid rise residential tower 
Brookfield will clearly help us think big and then will help us execute redevelopment opportunities more quickly  So as a first step with this alliance  we  and a dedicated team at Brookfield  will work together to assess the feasibility of the development of assets 
Once a plan for a particular asset is developed  Macys will have the ability to proceed or not to redevelop this asset  If we choose to redevelop the asset  the property will then be contributed into redevelopment joint venture  Macys can then  at that point  decide to take a cash settlement or contribute and participate in the redevelopment joint venture  And if we stay in as a partner in the joint venture  it is likely that upon stabilization  the redevelopment project would be sold and then profits distributed 
We are very excited by this alliance  and look forward to starting the work  We believe that having this single significant partnership will align interests and improve both communication and execution as compared to working with separate developers for each opportunity 
Terry  Jeff and I have confidence that Brookfields senior management is committed to making this alliance successful  and they share our optimism about the potential  We will continue to update you as we move forward on all three of these components of our real estate strategy  Our real estate team  along with our advisors  are doing a terrific job maximizing opportunities in our portfolio in a thoughtful way  while balancing the desire to move quickly 
Lets now move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter  The trend improvements relative to the spring season that we saw in the third quarter  combined with a more normal weather pattern  stabilization in international tourist sales and the mix benefit of the higher proportion of digital sales that happened in the holiday season  make us confident that we will be able to deliver an improved comp owned plus licensed sales trend in the fourth quarter  We are expecting comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis to be down approximatelyto down in the quarter  and we are expecting at least a  basis point improvement in the gross margin rate this year in the fourth quarter  Given our inventory position and our Last Act strategy  we believe this to be achievable  Remember  last year  our gross margin rate dropped  basis points versus so we do have a lot of room to improve 
SG AndA is expected to be up over last year in both dollars and rate in the fourth quarter  The investments in growth will continue  and we expect the income to be worse than last year by approximately  million to  million in the quarter  We recognize the expense investment needed to support our growth initiatives is not insignificant  and we are very focused on identifying opportunities for profit improvement in including decreasing our non payroll spend  improving the efficiency of our store operations and making sure we are structured to be both agile and cost effective  We dont have any specifics to report at this time  but know that this is an important part of our setup for our comeback 
Also  we are experiencing an additional delay in the construction of Brooklyn  and  as a result  the timing for booking of the gain is getting delayed more intoand
We now expect to book only  million this year  This is  million  or per share  lower than what we expected early inwhen we originally gave earnings guidance  While not insignificant  we remain comfortable that we can cover this shortfall and are sticking with our earnings guidance  but not changing guidance is actually a per share increase in our expectations from operations 
In the fourth quarter  we expect to book a million gain associated with Brooklyn  We are also anticipating other non flagship asset sales  including the Portland gain of approximatelymillion  which will take our annual number to approximatelymillion  which is consistent with the guidance at the start of the year  As you can tell  we are expecting quite a few transactions to close over the next few months 
Depreciation and amortization for the year is now estimated at approximately  billion  We are still tracking to our guidance for capital expenditures of approximatelymillion this year  We expect interest expense of roughlymillion and still the effective annual tax rate of approximatelyAll of these assumptions support our guidance for our setup year 
Our top management team here at Macys is stronger than ever  The combination of some very experienced executives and recently added talent is very powerful  The new senior executives bring important capabilities and experiences to the team  complementing those of us with deep history with the company  We are all energized by the new perspectives and know that this will have a positive impact on the business going forward 
As we outlined today  our organization is focused on doing all that we can to execute our strategies and drive the strong performance that will lead to a successful fourth quarter and improved results inand beyond  We head into the holidays with some momentum of some positive trends and with optimism in our assortments and marketing strategies  We have a lot of distinctive product and newness in our stores for holiday  And we feel great that our customer proposition is compelling  including our new Brookstone shops  our investment in the tech watch business  including Apple and Michael Kors  and our new Holiday Arcade  full of wonderful gift ideas 
We love this time of year  Macys is the destination for great holiday gift giving  And we are uniquely equipped to deliver the complete experience great product; best in class omni channel capability; and the store animation and holiday traditions that are so cherished by customers across the country 
And now  why dont I open the call for your questions?
Question and Answer Session
Operator
Thank you  Well now take our first question from Randy Konik with Jefferies 
Randal J  KonikJefferies LLC
Oh  thanks a lot  Hi  Karen  Good morning 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Hi  Good morning 
Randal J  KonikJefferies LLC
A couple things; one  I think its very encouraging youre seeing these AUR trends improve  So I just wanted to get a little bit more color on if you think – obviously  the inventory control is very positive as well  Is this more of an inventory control factor? Are you seeing more firmer pricing acceptance by the consumer or is it mix related  just a little bit more elaboration there? And then  within thego ahead  Im sorry 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Oh  go ahead
Randal J  KonikJefferies LLC
And then  lastly  just to elaborate on the trend in apparel  just so we can get some perspective on  it sounds like that category picked up  The weather wasnt as favorable  Now were getting more favorable weather  So just kind of curious on  holistically  the inventory control  those are more long term factors where the consumers act from a price acceptance perspective and then a little bit more near term on just the trends in apparel  given the weather  et cetera  Thanks 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yeah  I think the AUR increase is a combination of inventory control and having the right inventory and mix  And in terms of the apparel trends  we have seen really good business  and  again  across the board mens  kids and womens  lots of good things in denim and dresses and active  as I mentioned  the major brands  So it really is across the board  And frankly  the weather hasnt been so favorable  so if the weather turns cold – and today is a little colder  at least in New York – hopefully  that helps as well  But its very encouraging

Thank you  Well now take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank 
Paul TrussellDeutsche Bank Securities  Inc 
Good morning  Karen  A lot of your department store CFO peers are retiring  Certainly hope that you are able to hang out with us a little bit longer 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Thank you 
Paul TrussellDeutsche Bank Securities  Inc 
Certainly wanted to ask about the SG AndA  I know theres a few components and moving pieces here  but if you can just kind of maybe walk us through some of the changes  I believe that earlier in the year  you highlighted expectations for dollars to be down year over year  If you can just speak to SG AndA expectations now  both what happened in the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter  with real estate and excluding it  whats changed?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yeah  we actually had said early in the year that we expected it to be flattish  not down  I think now the year will be slightly up  But  again  if you focus on the annual  the increase feels reasonable  and thats the way I would think about it  if I were you  The credit performance has been worse than we had expected  so thats one piece of the reason for the increase; still a very strong profitability  but with credit sales declining  harder to keep the credit income dollars  And  as weve said  we are investing in some of these growth initiatives  which are great from a bottom line perspective but do add to expense  So I would say focus on the annual as youre thinking about SG AndA and not necessarily the fall season 
The other thing I would say to you is that we continue to want to keep investing in these growth initiatives  so we are looking really deep to find additional SG AndA reductions that  as I said  either are low hanging fruit  if there are such things at this point  but also trying to make the organization more cost effective  more agile and things like that  So its sort of a combined message  but I dont think  on an annual basis  were going to be that far different from what we had said at the start of the year

Thank you  Well now take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America 
Lorraine Maikis HutchinsonBank of America Merrill Lynch Research
Thank you  Good morning  Karen 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Morning 
Lorraine Maikis HutchinsonBank of America Merrill Lynch Research
Why do you think the private label credit card penetration has gone down? And did you say credit income would be down  million to  million? I guess I just wanted to know if thats simply the sales or if youre expecting any deterioration in metrics there 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
No  We had always expected the fourth quarter drop to be significant  having to do  frankly  just with quarters and the way it flowed last year  So the fact that its down by more than it has been in other quarters is not new news  Thats how we had expected it from the beginning of the year  It has been lower than we had expected  but we always expected that big drop in the fourth quarter 
I think on penetration last year  it was up quite a bit in the third quarter  so it may just be on a two year basis  it looks fine  But we are working hard to think about strategies for improving that metric in terms of the penetration  And again  its still at a very high level  but I think youll see us focus on this as we go forward 
Lorraine Maikis HutchinsonBank of America Merrill Lynch Research
And I know that theres a lot of moving pieces around SG AndA  but I think theres some debate out there as to when we think about next years growth rate  would it be closer to your full year flat or the exit rate  which will be up low single digits?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Id focus on the annual 
Lorraine Maikis HutchinsonBank of America Merrill Lynch Research
Okay  great 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
As we go forward  And again  well give a lot more color to that as we proceed 
Lorraine Maikis HutchinsonBank of America Merrill Lynch Research
All right  Thanks  Karen

Thank you  Well now take our next question from Oliver Chen with Cowen  And Company 
Oliver ChenCowen  And Co  LLC
so much  Karen  Macys is uniquely positioned as doing a great job with merchants and vendor relationships  So as you think about long term investors and the long run strategy  what are your thoughts about being un Amazonable in terms of what youll continue to do to innovate  just to make sure that your value proposition and convenience proposition is leading? And how should we think about the long run in terms of traffic? Like  do you think the setup for next year is going to be a positive traffic year? Id just love your thoughts on that long term factor  as we want to see you gain share 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yeah  I think the first question is a good one  one we think about  but I do think that our organization and  as you said  our merchants be able to curate the market  find the right product really is a competitive advantage relative to Amazon  And when you combine that with the really terrific store organization that we have  I do believe for fashion  customers still love going into the stores  trying things on  Even if they end up buying online from our apps  they still experience the store  And so I think both of those will allow us to always compete effectively against an Amazon; doesnt mean that an Amazon wont do a lot of business  Im not saying that 
But I think in the categories that we carry  most of them  I do think the omni channel is a benefit and the quality of our merchant team  both in terms of our private brands  Our MMG team is spectacular  And developing product that will only be available at Macys will be a piece of that as well  And also given  the customers  frankly  that you can only get at Macys  So its a combination of those factors that I think will enable us to compete effectively against an Amazon 
In terms of the traffic and transactions  thats obviously a harder thing to predict  And thats partly why were so happy to see the AUR doing well  with our inventory levels and clearance strategy working  So I think well do everything we can to grow the number of transactions  but it dont think well count on that as we go into next year 
Oliver ChenCowen  And Co  LLC
Okay  And  Karen  can we get your take? Now that the elections over  is that a positive catalyst? Its very hard to answer this  I believe  but would love
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Therefore  Im not going to answer it  I have no clue  I have no clue  Well all watch together 
Oliver ChenCowen  And Co  LLC
Okay  Well  its great to hear the green shoots on apparel  so people are out there and interested 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
I agree

Thank you  Well now take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley 
Kimberly Conroy GreenbergerMorgan Stanley  And Co  LLC
Great  Thank you so much  Karen  Im wondering if you could perhaps look out over the next one  two  three years and talk to us about how we should think about just SG AndA growth from here  What might be the puts and takes? Obviously  we would expect to see some savings from store operations  as an example  as you work through the next  closures  but Im wondering if you can just sort of give us the pluses and minuses on the SG AndA ledger as we go forward  Thanks 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Thats a hard question  Kimberly  to answer sort of off the cuff  and were in the process  obviously  of developing plans for next year  But I think youre going to see factors similar to what weve seen this year  We do want to invest in growth; digital  you know  both software  but also  obviously  delivery costs and things like that that add to expense  Also  obviously  wage pressure  particularly in the field  is an issue  But we are working hard to find offsets to all of that 
And so I think when we give guidance next year  we can be more fulsome in terms of the puts and takes  at least as we go forward  But I think were being realistic about projecting what we think we need  both to spend and also save  as we move forward 
Kimberly Conroy GreenbergerMorgan Stanley  And Co  LLC
Okay  Thank you  Karen  And just to follow up on the real estate  if I could  obviously  youve got an ambitious plan of this next  store closures that youve already announced  Im wondering as you continue to evaluate the rest of the fleet beyond the  that youve targeted  do you have any thoughts on additional opportunities for real estate actions beyond that next ? Thank you 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Do you mean that  Kimberly  in terms of closures?
Kimberly Conroy GreenbergerMorgan Stanley  And Co  LLC
Potential closures
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Beyond the ?
Kimberly Conroy GreenbergerMorgan Stanley  And Co  LLC
Yeah  potential closures beyond theThank you 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Well  when we announced the  a couple of months ago  we had looked out a couple of years  and so at this point  I do believe thats roughly the number of closures we expect  Having said that  as I talked about with the Brookfield alliance  we are looking to potentially redevelop area around stores  parts of stores beyond that  But in terms of closures  at this point  the  is what we anticipate  roughly

Thank you  Well now take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs 
Lindsay Drucker MannGoldman Sachs  And Co 
Thanks  Good morning  Karen 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Good morning 
Lindsay Drucker MannGoldman Sachs  And Co 
I wanted to ask a little bit on inventory  Its been an important topic for apparel retailers and vendors across the last couple quarters  and whether  as you think about over the next couple quarters or longer term  what the opportunities are to get more efficient  maybe how youre working with some of your – either in your private label or with some of your most important partners to do that 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Well  were always trying to make decisions as close as we can to when the merchandise is going to arrive in store  so were doing that both with private brand and also working with the vendors  And  in part  thats why we like the flexibility that the lower inventory is giving us  But were constantly looking for ways of making the whole supply chain more efficient  whether it be private brand or with our major partners  Its one of the benefits of the great partnerships we have  as Oliver mentioned a few minutes ago 
Lindsay Drucker MannGoldman Sachs  And Co 
Great  And just a follow up on your loyalty programs or your credit card  whether theres any special initiatives we should be looking forward to in the next couple quarters?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
At this point  no  but something we are working on

And well now take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citi 
Paul LejuezCitigroup Global Markets  IncBroker 
Hey  Thanks 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Hi  Paul 
Paul LejuezCitigroup Global Markets  IncBroker 
Hey  there  Karen  youd mentioned  I think  positive trends heading into holiday; I think what you said  So can you maybe talk about the sales trajectory over the quarter? Sorry if I missed that 
And then separately  can you quantify the gross margin benefit from Last Act? And maybe as you think about fourth quarter specifically  how much of the improvement that you expect is from the Last Act strategy versus just being in a much better position from an inventory perspective? Thanks 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Im not sure I could answer that question in terms of whats Last Act and whats being in a better – it all works together  So  sorry  Im not going to be able to help with that one 
Paul LejuezCitigroup Global Markets  IncBroker 
Got it  And on the sales trajectory over the quarter?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
I think I would look at the quarter in total  Promotional events move around  so its really hard to give an answer that would be helpful  but we were pleased that the third quarter was better than what we had experienced in the first half of the year as we head into the fourth quarter 
Paul LejuezCitigroup Global Markets  IncBroker 
Okay  And then  just one follow up; you closed stores last year  Can you talk about what youve seen on the sales recapture? Whether or not youre getting the levels that you were hoping for? Wheres it coming  either at another store or online? And how does that make you think about the  to come this year?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Well  I would say were doing a little bit better than what we had anticipated with those stores  One of the good things that has happened is in a multi store market  when we close a store  we are no longer losing business online  which was something we had experienced a couple of years ago  So weve been able to improve on that  In a single store market  wed still lose  com business when we close a store  but at least in a multi store market  that isnt happening  So thats really good news 
Were also finding that were able to retain more of the sales; in part  because were making these decisions and thinking about our assortment earlier  which is helpful  So I think we feel better about our abilities to do that  and we keep refining our assortment strategies and our marketing strategies so that we can even retain more of the sales as we go to close  obviously  a much bigger number

Well now take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan 
Matthew Robert BossJPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey  Karen 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Hey  Matt 
Matthew Robert BossJPMorgan Securities LLC
So on capital allocation  you resumed some share repurchase this quarter  Can you just talk about the criteria that you considered and then  just how to think about debt paydown versus buyback versus dividend as we think going forward?

Sure  Yeah  I think you all will remember that the first quarter was a worse quarter than we had anticipated  and that was the time at which we lowered our sales and earnings guidance for the year  And we  frankly  just said  you know what? We dont know whats going to happen  Lets wait and see if the second quarter improves  just to be sure  before we head into the fall  The second quarter  obviously  improved quite a bit and gave us the stability and confidence to resume the buyback  So thats really the thinking there 
In terms of allocation going forward  as I said  use for the business always comes first  but  again  we dont see a dramatic increase in spending needed to do that  And so there will be lots of cash available  both for the dividend  buyback  and also we may do some debt repurchases depending on how we end the year  because weve always said having a healthy balance sheet is really important to the company  And we just may decide to do that  But  again  were not making those decisions until we get through the end of the year

Got it  And then  just a follow up; if we think about this quarter  so if we think about sales  gross margin and SG AndA  what was actually above or below your plan in the third quarter? I know there were some moving pieces on the street 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Honestly  it was all just about as we anticipated  Sales were as we anticipated  Margin was  as was SG AndA  Asset sale gains moved around a little bit  but thats the only thing  And thats always going to happen

Thank you  Well now take our next question from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada 
Brian Jay TunickRBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks  Good morning  Karen 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Good morning 
Brian Jay TunickRBC Capital Markets LLC
Two questions; I guess one is on your Q  comp guidance  I guess listening to some of your vendors talking about quality of sales initiatives  pulling back on friends and family  just curious; have you already contemplated some of those vendors not participating as much in the Q  events around holiday? And then the second question  we had a chance to go visit the Easton store prototype  and we were wondering what could be the pacing of some of those initiatives that we saw in that store rolling out to the majority of the fleet next year  if you could just maybe highlight some of the key takeaways 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yeah  in terms of the sales guidance  the answer is yes  If you think about our guidance of minusto minus  on a two year basis  the minusis  frankly  comparable with year to date  And the minus on a two year basis is consistent with the third quarter  So I think its all very reasonable as youre looking forward  And  yes  we have contemplated the changes that youre referring to 
In terms of Easton  were obviously still monitoring the results  One of the things weve seen a lot of success with was the tech watch installation and that has already been rolled out as we head into the holidays  as we got very quick feedback  Also  some of the fine jewelry initiatives that  as you know  we had piloted in California but did some new things in Easton that were also rolling out  so  yes  we are beginning to take those learnings and move forward

Thank you  Well move on to our next question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities 
Robert DrbulGuggenheim Securities LLC
Good morning  Karen 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Hey  Bob 
Robert DrbulGuggenheim Securities LLC
Just got a couple of questions; when you think about the fourth quarter competitive environment and your gross margin comparison versus last year  I think you said up at least  basis points  What are the biggest opportunities to recapture versus that almost ?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
All of it relates to the inventory position 
Robert DrbulGuggenheim Securities LLC
Okay  And in terms of like cold weather inventories  can you just talk about your positioning there going into the next six months? 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yeah  so we had a few very cold winters than we had last year with the degree weather in most of the country in December  And so this year  we tried to sort of take an average of the two and think about it that way  But if it ends up being a lot colder  theres no question well get more inventory if we need it  And if it ends up being as warm as last year  well probably have some excess inventory  but  hopefully  well work our way through that 
Robert DrbulGuggenheim Securities LLC
Got it  And then  on the Backstage piece of the business  can you just talk about how youre buying inventory there  sort of the collaborative efforts throughout the organization?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yeah  weve got a whole separate organization  very small  by the way  but quite busy doing our Backstage buying  And in most cases or in a lot of cases  going to completely different vendors and  in some case  merchandise that we dont even carry in the store  So  in part  the test that were doing this fall with those stores in putting mens and womens apparel purchased by our Backstage buyers the way that they do  and putting that merchandise next to Last Act and  like Last Act being coupon ineligible  we think is going to be an interesting test to see about bringing new product in  In the stores  were actually putting categories in that we dont carry in the store 
So  for example  in toys  well have high end scooters or Big Wheels  In home decor  things like decorative figurines  pet accessories  the kinds of things that we dont sell in a typical Macys that we think the Backstage buyers are better equipped to buy  and well see how it sells in the stores  So were actually excited about these tests  and well see 
Robert DrbulGuggenheim Securities LLC
Got it  And then  just one last question is on the shipping expense  as you think about the holiday season this year  can you just talk about how youre approaching minimums in terms of shipping or free shipping or how we should think about that piece of the business in gross margin?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Well  there is going to be a lot of  as you might imagine  reduced shipping thresholds offered throughout the holiday season  but relatively comparable to a year ago  So I dont see any major change  unless the business grows a lot more than were anticipating  which we hope happens 
Robert DrbulGuggenheim Securities LLC

Thank you  Well now move on to our next question from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo 
Todd DuvickWells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes  Good morning  Karen 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Good morning 
Todd DuvickWells Fargo Securities LLC
I have a question for you with respect to your comment in your prepared remarks about getting your leverage back to the leverage target range within a reasonable time  Can you tell me  is that reasonable time something that is determined internally or in concert with the rating agencies? How are you thinking about that?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Well  obviously  we always would take rating agency views into consideration  but it is something that well talk about internally  Our desire to have a healthy balance sheet is internally driven  And so  we will take feedback  but we will make the decision ourselves 
Todd DuvickWells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay  And I think I heard you also say in your prepared remarks that youre planning to pay off the maturity that is coming due December as opposed to refinancing that  Is that correct?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Thats correct 
Todd DuvickWells Fargo Securities LLC
Excellent  Thank you  Karen

Thank you  Well now move on to our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS 
Michael BinettiUBS Securities LLC
Hey  Karen  Good morning 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Hi  Michael  Good morning 
Michael BinettiUBS Securities LLC
Thanks for all the detail today  very helpful  If I just look at the average unit retail trend  I know it was asked a little bit  but if I look back over a couple of years and just try to think of multi year average unit retails  so snapping back a bit  Thats correlated with you guys getting lean and mean on the comp inventories  But as we look ahead to next year  theres going to be some new inputs to that line  namely  youre shutting down stores that Im guessing are in markets where youd have a lower AUR  Can you help us think about as we look out to next year  do you feel like as you go into the strategic initiatives that you have with the store closures and now that weve lapped the AUR reductions a year ago  do you think were going to end up in a place where AUR is still contributing in a positive basis or even contributing substantially next year?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
We expect it to contribute positively as we go forward 
Michael BinettiUBS Securities LLC
Okay  And thats because of the store closures or are lower AUR or not? I just want to be clear on that  
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Its everything  Its everything 
Michael BinettiUBS Securities LLC
And then  let me ask you similarly on transactions; were you surprised to see the transactions not lift off a little bit in the third quarter as the compares got easier? And how are you thinking about that as you go into next year  again considering you have some smaller stores youll be closing that Im guessing have traffic issues?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yeah  and look  our hope is that a lot of these growth initiatives and the things that were doing in terms of improving service in our stores  as well as improvements on our apps  will actually help improve upon that trend in terms of traffic  So well see as we go forward 
Michael BinettiUBS Securities LLC
Okay  Thanks  Karen

Thank you  Well now move on our next question from Richard Jaffe with Stifel 
Richard JaffeStifel  Nicolaus  And CoInc 
Thanks very much  guys  And  Karen  could you talk about the partners you have in stores  starting with Lids and just going through the list and how theyre performing  how the partnerships are working out and opportunities you see in that way as a  I guess  a partner or a landlord with some these companies? Thanks 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Sure  Yeah  look  we have had great success both at Macys and at Bloomingdales with these licensed partners  whether it be Sunglass Hut  Finish Line or a lot of the vendors that are licensed at Bloomingdales  And its a great way of bringing product into the store where we cant have access or dont have access to it on our own  And so  we continue to look for ways of bringing either new categories or new vendors or new products into our store in that way  if that makes the most sense  So I think it will be an important part of our strategy as we go forward 
Richard JaffeStifel  Nicolaus  And CoInc 
Anything you can share with us for either holiday or for next year?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Not at this point 
Richard JaffeStifel  Nicolaus  And CoInc 
Okay  Thank you

Thank you  Well now take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research 
David J  GlickThe Buckingham Research Group  Inc 
Thank you  Karen  Couple questions; Backstage  is it fair to say that that strategy seems to be going forward less focused on standalone stores and more kind of utilizing your asset base on your existing stores?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yes 
David J  GlickThe Buckingham Research Group  Inc 
Okay 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yes  because  again  we cant do everything  And were getting such success in store because not only is Backstage doing well  but its improving the productivity of most of the base stores  which is a good thing  So thats where weve decided to put our focus  at least for now 
David J  GlickThe Buckingham Research Group  Inc 
Okay  Thank you  Next question; it would seem that youre getting a better recapture rate in your closed doors this year  and it seems like that would be a tailwind for you guys next year with a greater number of store closings  What kind of recapture rate  or range of recapture  are you seeing? And what would you expect so we can think about what kind of comp lift you may be able to get  all things being equal  for next year?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
It is not significant  even though its  stores closing  in terms of the lift on total stores  Its a little bit  but not as much as you might think  in terms of the impact  So even with significant retention  it doesnt do that much for the comp growth 
David J  GlickThe Buckingham Research Group  Inc 
So tens of basis points as opposed to anything like a hundred 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yes  Exactly 
David J  GlickThe Buckingham Research Group  Inc 
And then  a lot of investors are trying to get their arms around sort of the value creation potential from your real estate and  obviously  a significant step forward with Brookfield  I mean  should we think about this in terms of hundreds of millions  more than billion? Like whats kind of the range of potential value creation that you could get from this setup?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
I dont know the answer to that  Were obviously just starting to explore  We do think its significant  And we do also hope that it helps the retail operation as we do this  so the value could come in a couple of buckets  but  at this point  its just premature 
David J  GlickThe Buckingham Research Group  Inc 
Okay  And then  last question  if I could sneak it in  The fashion watch business was a big driver for you  then a big headwind  Do you see this business potentially comping positive again with some of the innovations youre seeing in tech watches? And is this something that could help lift your center core business?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Well  its a little early to be judging  but it feels good  Whether it gets to that point  David  its just too early to tell  but it does feel good 
David J  GlickThe Buckingham Research Group  Inc 
Okay  great  Thank you very much  Good luck in the fourth quarter

Thank you  Well now take our next question from Wayne Hood with BMO Capital 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
Good morning  Karen 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Morning 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
I was just wondering  as you think about Macys contribution to redevelopment capital into a potential JV with Brookfield  are those one  would you be willing to put up a significant amount of capital; or are some of those assets that would be put into that JV  are they leverageable so you really wouldnt necessarily have a big high capital redevelopment cost?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Way early too early to make those decisions  We have to see what the plans look like and what value creation opportunities we think it provides for us 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
Okay  And would you anticipate retaining control of any JV structure that you put together with them?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Its just too early  Wayne 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
Okay  Another question  unrelated to Brookfield  was just on Michigan Avenue; when you look at what your competitors have done there and you look at your location  it looks like it – obviously  youve talked about it in the past  Maybe remodel capital may be needed  Whats your current thinking about the remodel capital for that store? Can you also enter into a JV where you have a partner that comes in and contributes capital and the timing of anything that might need to take place there?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Are you talking about Water Tower or the Bloomingdales?
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
No  Water Tower 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
We have remodeled the store  I cant imagine us bringing in a partner to remodel a store 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
No  I know you did 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
We have sufficient cash 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
Yeah  I know you did  but I guess my point is you still feel like its competitive in that marketplace  even with that remodel?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
The store is doing well 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
Okay  Final question; themillion in capital spending that you expect this year  should we be thinking about that as a trough number or given things like redevelopment capital  that that number probably goes tobillion billion? How should we be thinking about that number?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Im not sure what you mean by trough  but  as I said  part of the proceeds  for example  at Union Square mens  are going to go to putting mens back into the main Union Square store  So that spending would be incremental to the capital budget  but  at this point  I dont anticipate it going up as high as what youre talking about 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
Okay  So relatively stable  Okay 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yes 
Lowell Wayne HoodBMO Capital Markets  United States 
All right  Thanks  Karen

Thank you  Well now take our final question from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research 
Jeffrey SteinNorthcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay  good morning  Karen 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Hi  Jeff 
Jeffrey SteinNorthcoast Research Partners LLC
A couple of real quick questions; first of all  good to see that the tourist markets are stabilizing  but if my math is correct  if you adjust out the impact from the tourist drag in Qyour comps in Q  were down And lets say it was relatively neutral in QThat would make minus So it looks like sequentially  youve actually seen a weakening in comps  and Im wondering  am I looking at that correctly?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
No  What you have to do  Jeff  and I said this after the second quarter  is really looking at the spring season rather than just the second quarter  just because of some shifts  The first quarter was worse than it should been  The second quarter was better  So I would look at the spring season and how that flows into the third quarter 
Jeffrey SteinNorthcoast Research Partners LLC
Got it  And wondering if you could just comment on two businesses; one  cosmetics  and the other  footwear; I think earlier in the year  you indicated that youre doing some tests similar to what you did in jewelry on the West Coast in footwear  and wondering how thats working  And exactly  what are you doing differently in footwear? And secondly  what your thinking is with respect to the weaker performance in cosmetics relative to some of the performance weve seen from other specialty retailers  like Sephora and ULTA  which seem to be taking some share  and what you might be doing to mitigate that?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Yeah  on the shoe business  youre correct  We did start a pilot earlier in the year that is doing extremely well  And our shoe business was actually one of the callouts in total for strength in the third quarter  So we feel very good about what we have done there  And as a result of the strength in fine jewelry and in shoes based on our changes in the business trends with our strategies  weve now moved on to cosmetics 
And so cosmetics was one of the weaker businesses in the third quarter  And were now focused on improving that  like weve done with jewelry and like weve done with shoes  Oftentimes  you guys think of cosmetics as both sort of color  skincare and fragrances; should point out that the fragrance business has been very strong of those sort of three components of what you tend to think of as cosmetics  which  by the way  is great as we head into the fourth quarter  which is a heavy penetration of fragrance  But cosmetics  Jeff  is next on our list of attacking to figure out a strategy for making it stronger 
Jeffrey SteinNorthcoast Research Partners LLC
Perfect  And what exactly have you been doing differently in shoes on the West Coast?
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Its been a combination of editing the assortment; in some cases  displaying the product more by category than vendor; and also  frankly  utilizing technology as well as some more staffing behind the scenes  meaning in the stock rooms  to make the shopping experience more friction free for the customer  So its sort of the combination of improved assortment  greater editing of the assortment  better service  but its working extraordinarily well 
Jeffrey SteinNorthcoast Research Partners LLC
Great 
Karen M  HoguetMacys  Inc 
Were also testing  in some stores  open sell  which  for a smaller store  appears to be a very good answer for us  So lots more to come on that  but we feel really good about the business
